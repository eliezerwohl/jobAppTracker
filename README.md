# jobAppTracker

Making a job application tracker.  Current using Trello, but I have in mind serveral steps that would help:

1.Organization.  Why not make the cards auto put themselves in order (alphabetical)?  Why not be able to search for cards?  I've applied to over 60 jobs.  It's getting hard to keep track of.

2.Stats.  Why not see what sources are legit are not?  See how many app per week I send out.  See the avg between sent in app and first response.  Maybe I get more front end offers than full stack.  


Some notes:
Using mongodb.  Perhaps keeping an array of all the positions would be useful, but keeping a "current position" would be good too.
Using Node.js
using react
